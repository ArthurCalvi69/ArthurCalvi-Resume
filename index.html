        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm an incoming college student at the University of California, Riverside as a Political Science Major. I want to gain more experience by
distancing myself from menial jobs and truly feel like what I do is purposeful/productive. I feel very ambitious and feel that I can add to any
arising job opportunity. Although seemingly limited, my experience in both desk work and physical labor brings what I feel is a better
perspective on problem-solving.<br><br>

        "Foremost, I participate in activities that bring the community together. The ability for people to both coexist and cooperate succinctly is something I hold especially important morally. I participate in school walk-outs and community protests to bring awareness to issues like racial inequity so I can have those thought-provoking conversations with ill-informed people. My first job at fourteen was as a referee and receptionist at a soccer complex in the Canal, the most prominent Latinx immigrant community in Marin. Through conversations with many different Latinx people living there,  I was able to get my head around and appreciate their perspective. I saw the polarization of income inequality in Marin County firsthand. Just blocks away from a community ravaged by gun violence and the ever-growing threat of ICE was a bold Whole Foods grocery store. This significant component to the gentrification of the Latinx people in Marin County felt like an unjust slap in the face for those trying to support their families. These very people make up just under one-fifth of Marin's total population. The job taught me to be more grateful and self-aware. On a more personal note, to gain more independence and learn more about my heritage, I got a job at the Jewish Community Center. As an event worker, I got to listen in on speakers and speak to them after events. The most memorable speaker was a black woman who used spoken-word poems and the power of music to address and acknowledge racial injustices in America. At that moment, I understood I needed to do more than the bare minimum with the privilege I hold and educate myself on the injustices of the oppressed. I decided it was necessary to have difficult conversations with friends and family to begin purging any ignorance or prejudices." -My UCPIQ<br><br>

        "My family is built upon different perspectives and cultures and centered around acceptance and the humanity of all people. It's the driving reason I want to study political science. I see my mom's side of the family as a microcosm of the United States. My Jewish Great-Grandmother fleed Austria in fear of Nazi persecution. She brought acceptance to the forefront of our family's beliefs. It includes being both culturally aware and appreciative of different races, religions, gender identities, and sexual orientations through empathetic practices. I pride myself on having grown up in a big, diverse family. My Tio Mario had to leave his birth country because of the Nicaraguan Revolution in search of safety. After living with an Aunt in Guatemala, he walked the entire distance to the U.S. to immigrate here. My Uncle Kwame and cousins are black men who fear for their lives and liberty when any situation with a police officer arises. My dad, an Italian Immigrant, gave me two priceless things, an international perspective, and ambitions. After leaving Italy at age nineteen, he lived in three countries abroad and can speak four languages. I am both lucky and unlucky because the entirety of my dad's family still lives in Italy. I am grateful to get to travel to Europe quite often to visit them, but I will never get to see them as often as I would like. I try to take after my dad's adventurous, independent mindset and intend to broaden my perspective and eventually study abroad with the help of my dual U.S. and Italian citizenship. I plan to be the first person on his side of the family to graduate from college." -My UCPIQ
